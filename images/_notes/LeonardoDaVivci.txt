Leonardo has been called a genius and the archetypal Renaissance Person; his talents extended far beyond his artistic works. Like many leaders of Renaissance humanism, he did not see a divide between science and art. His observations and inventions were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, including designs for flying machines, war machinery, anatomy and architecture.
